  %p To the extent that we collect and use personal data of the user such as, in particular, the user’s IP address, upon an access to the Website, the legal basis therefor is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by makandra. The legitimate interests pursued by makandra are the enhancement of data protection and data security in order to ensure a level of security for the personal data processed by makandra which is appropriate to the risk, to ensure network and information security, to optimise the Website and to protect the Website against attacks, disruption and damage.

  %p Legal basis for processing these personal data is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between makandra and the data subject or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.


  %h4#cookies c) Use of cookies

  %p
    In using the Website, cookies will be used. The purpose of cookies is the personalisation of the Website for your visit and the facilitation of the use of the Website. Cookies are small text files which the Website transmits to the cookie file of the Internet browser on your terminal device and which are kept there for a later retrieval, so that the Website can, inter alia, remember who you are. Typically, a cookie will include the name of the domain from where it was set, the “lifetime” of the cookie and a unique identifier. The following types of cookies are used on the Website:

  %ul
    %li Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies, which are kept in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website and which are necessary, in particular, in order that you can use the Website and make downloads from it. Session cookies will be deleted once you terminate the browser session. The legal basis for the processing of personal data by session cookies (if any) is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between makandra and the data subject or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, i.e., in order that makandra can enable you to use the Website.
    %li Cookies in connection with Google Analytics, as described in section 3 d) below.

  %p
    If you do not want to accept cookies of the Website, you can deactivate them and object to the access to information stored before by setting your Internet browser accordingly. The settings of your browser which allow you to do this vary from browser to browser and can normally be found under “Data Protection” or “Cookies” of the “Internet Options” or “Settings” menu of your browser. If you need help to deactivate or delete cookies, you should use the “Help” menu in your browser.

Please note, however, that you may not be able to use all of the interactive features and functions of the Website if cookies are blocked or deleted.


  %h4 d) Use of Google Analytics

  %p
    This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (<b>"Google"</b>).

  %p
    Google Analytics uses so called "cookies", i.e., small text files that are stored on the computer of the user and make it possible to analyse the Website usage. Usually the information stored in cookies about the Website usage is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and saved there. On makandra’s Website IP anonymization is enabled so that Google will shorten the user’s IP address within a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there so that data processing might take place outside the European Union. In such case personal data collected by means of Google Analytics will be transferred to the USA. Google Inc. is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (see #{url_link 'https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI'}) and thus has provided the legal requirements for ensuring an adequate level of data protection for the provision of the Google Analytics service by means of processing on behalf of the controller.

  %p
    The user can object to the use of Google Analytics and prevent the storage of cookies by respective browser settings as explained above under section 3 c). The user can also stop data (incl. his IP address) created by cookies and associated with his website usage from being sent to Google or processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser add-on for deactivation of the Google Analytics JavaScrip available at the following link #{url_link 'http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en'}.

  %p
    Further information and the current privacy policies of Google can be retrieved at #{url_link 'https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/'} and #{url_link 'https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de&ref_topic=2919631'}.

  %p
    Legal basis for using Google Analytics is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as using Google Analytics is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by makandra. The legitimate interests pursued by makandra are to evaluate the number of visits and to analyse the use of the Website in order to improve the Website, its user-friendliness and the offers from makandra and make them more interesting for the user.
